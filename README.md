# Programming DS&Algo

Here I am going to write solution for various programming and ds related questions. The code is structered in a way that there is separate class for separate data structure like TreeProblems class only deals with problem related to Trees and same for others.
For most of the questions the problem link is given to understand the problem more. 
     unchecked # [checkbox:unchecked]
    checked # [checkbox:checked]
    checked # [checkbox:checked]
    .

    # [checkbox:unchecked]
    [-] # '[-]'
    [o] # '[o]'
    [O] # '[O]'
